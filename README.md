# GoFa Palettizer Useful Code Snippets Repository ü§ñ

This repository contains useful code snippets for the GoFa CRB15000 Palettizer. The code is written in RAPID, a high-level language used for programming ABB industrial robots.

## Kinematics ü¶ï

An Excel file reports the kinematic parameters of the GoFa CRB15000 variants. The file contains the Denavit-Hartenberg parameters, see GoFa‚Ñ¢: Kinematic and dynamic parameters
of GoFa 5 TechNote.

## Custom MoveL and MoveJ Functions ü§ñ

The `MoveLHomeMade` and `MoveJHomeMade` functions are custom movement functions designed to move the robot to a specific position while avoiding singularities. These functions ensure that joint 4 is always at 0¬∞ and joint 5 is always at 90¬∞. 

### Requirements 

The tool has to have the tool0 orientation and only with z-value. Workobjects and targets have to be reachable by the robot in palletizing configuration.

### Usage 

You can use these functions in the same way as the standard `MoveL` and `MoveJ` functions in RAPID:

```RAPID
    ! Like MoveL and MoveJ
    MoveJHomeMade Target_10, v1000, fine, MyTool\WObj:=wobj0;
    MoveLHomeMade Target_20, v1000, fine, MyTool\WObj:=wobj0;
```
